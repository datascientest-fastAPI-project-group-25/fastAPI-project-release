## Explanation

Recommended Branching Strategy
	1.	Main Branch:
	▪	Purpose: Acts as the stable version of your configuration that reflects the production environment.
	▪	Usage: Only well-tested and approved changes are merged into the main branch.
	2.	Feature Branches:
	▪	Purpose: Used for developing new features, testing configurations, or making changes that are not yet ready for production.
	▪	Usage: Developers create feature branches from the main branch to work on specific tasks or updates. Once the work is complete and tested, these branches are merged back into the main branch.
	3.	Environment Folders Within Branches:
	▪	Structure: Instead of having separate branches for each environment, use folders within the main branch to represent different environments (as previously described in the environment-per-folder strategy).
	▪	Purpose: This maintains a single source of truth while allowing for environment-specific configurations.

-  **Base Directory**: Contains the common configuration files like `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, and `configmap.yaml`. These files define the core setup that is shared across all environments.
-  **Environments Directory**: Contains subdirectories for each environment (e.g., dev, staging, production). Each environment has its own `values.yaml` and `overlay.yaml` files that specify environment-specific configurations.
-  **Values and Overlay Files**: These files allow you to customize configurations for each environment.

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Using folders instead of branches simplifies the management of configurations and reduces complexity.
2. **Alignment with Tools**: Aligns well with Kubernetes tools like Helm and Kustomize.
3. **Avoids Configuration Drift**: Reduces the risk of configuration drift.
4. **Easy Promotion**: Promoting changes between environments involves copying or updating files in the respective
