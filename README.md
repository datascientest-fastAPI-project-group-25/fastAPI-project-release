## Prerequisites

The project uses several tools that will be automatically checked and installed as needed. To begin:

```bash
make init
```

This command will:
1. Detect your operating system (macOS, Linux, or Windows)
2. Install Bun (JavaScript/TypeScript runtime) if not present
3. Check for and help you install other required tools:
   - Git (Version control)
   - Docker (Container runtime)
   - Kubectl (Kubernetes CLI)
   - k3d (Local Kubernetes)
   - Helm (Kubernetes package manager)

The initialization process is platform-aware and will provide appropriate installation instructions for your system.

For macOS users with Homebrew, you can install all required tools with:
```bash
brew install git docker kubectl k3d helm
```

You'll also need:
- Kubernetes cluster
- Argo CD installed
- GitHub Container Registry access

## Release Strategy

This project follows a streamlined release strategy with feature/fix branches that merge directly into the main branch:

1. **Development Workflow**:
   - Create feature/fix branches from main (`feat/*` or `fix/*`)
   - Push changes to GitHub to automatically create a PR
   - PR triggers tests and validation workflows
   - After review and approval, merge to main

2. **Deployment Process**:
   - Main branch changes trigger deployment to staging
   - After validation in staging, promote to production
   - ArgoCD manages the deployment process

3. **Environments**:
   - **Staging**: Pre-production environment for validation
   - **Production**: Live environment

## Environment Overview

### Development
- Branch: `main`
- Values: `config/helm/values.yaml`
- Features:
  - Debug mode enabled
  - Minimal resources
  - Local development optimized

### Staging
- Branch: `stg`
- Values: `config/helm/staging.yaml`
- Features:
  - Debugging enabled
  - Moderate resource limits
  - Automated deployments
  - Single replica per service

### Production
- Branch: `main`
- Values: `config/helm/production.yaml`
- Features:
  - Debugging disabled
  - High resource limits
  - Multiple replicas
  - Autoscaling enabled
  - Enhanced security
  - TLS enabled

## Deployment Methods

### Using Scripts

The repository includes several utility scripts to manage deployments:

```bash
# Deploy to development environment
./scripts/deploy-dev.sh

# Deploy to production environment
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh

# Clean up environments
./scripts/cleanup.sh dev    # Clean development environment
./scripts/cleanup.sh prod   # Clean production environment
./scripts/cleanup.sh all    # Clean all environments
```

### Using Docker (Platform-Agnostic Setup)

For a consistent setup experience across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), you can use the Docker-based setup:

```bash
# Set up a local k3d cluster using Docker
make setup-k3d-docker
```

This method uses a Docker container that includes all the necessary tools (k3d, kubectl, Helm) and runs the setup script inside the container. This approach ensures that the setup process is consistent regardless of the host operating system.

Requirements:
- Docker
- Docker Compose

The Docker-based setup automatically:
1. Builds a container with all required tools
2. Sets up a local k3d cluster
3. Installs ArgoCD
4. Configures the necessary components

### Using GitHub Actions

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with the following workflows:

1. **PR Automation (`pr-automation.yml`)**
   - Triggers on pushes to feature/* and fix/* branches
   - Automatically creates a PR if one doesn't exist
   - Adds appropriate labels and descriptions
   - Deletes branches automatically after PR is merged

2. **ArgoCD Configuration Tests (`helm-argocd-test.yml`)**
   - Triggers on PR creation and updates affecting ArgoCD configurations
   - Validates ArgoCD application manifests
   - Prepares deployment manifests for testing
   - Focuses specifically on ArgoCD-related configurations

3. **Helm Chart Test (`helm-test.yml`)**
   - Triggers on pull requests and pushes to main
   - Validates Helm charts across all environments
   - Runs comprehensive chart-testing
   - Tests chart installation in a Kind cluster

4. **Helm Chart Deploy (`helm-deploy.yml`)**
   - Deploys to development, staging, and production environments
   - Supports manual triggering with environment selection
   - Includes validation and verification steps
   - Manages environment-specific configurations

5. **ArgoCD Integration (`argocd-integration.yml`)**
   - Manually triggered workflow for ArgoCD integration
   - Configures ArgoCD applications for different environments
   - Manages deployment synchronization
   - Provides deployment status and URLs

## Deployment Process

1. Images are built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io/datascientest-fastapi-project-group-25)
2. CI pipeline updates image tags in the appropriate values file
3. Argo CD detects changes and syncs the application

### Initial Setup

1. Install Argo CD:
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace argocd
   kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
   ```

2. Configure GitHub Container Registry credentials:
   ```bash
   kubectl create secret docker-registry ghcr-secret \
     --docker-server=ghcr.io \
     --docker-username=<github-username> \
     --docker-password=<github-pat> \
     --namespace=fastapi-helm
   ```

3. Set up ArgoCD API key for CI/CD integration and store it as a GitHub secret:
   ```bash
   # Run the setup script to configure ArgoCD, generate an API key, and store it as a GitHub secret
   ./scripts/setup-argocd-github.sh
   ```

4. Apply Argo CD applications:
   ```bash
   # For staging
   kubectl apply -f config/argocd/staging.yaml

   # For production
   kubectl apply -f config/argocd/production.yaml
   ```

### ArgoCD Integration

The repository includes scripts and workflows for ArgoCD integration:

1. **Manual Setup**:
   - Use `./scripts/setup-argocd-github.sh` to install and configure ArgoCD
   - Generate an API key for CI/CD integration
   - Automatically store the API key and server URL as GitHub secrets (`ARGOCD_AUTH_TOKEN` and `ARGOCD_SERVER`)

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - The `argocd-integration.yml` workflow configures ArgoCD applications
   - Main branch changes trigger deployment to staging
   - After validation, changes can be promoted to production

3. **PR Testing**:
   - When a PR is created, the `helm-argocd-test.yml` workflow validates Helm charts and ArgoCD configurations
   - The workflow prepares deployment manifests for testing
   - These manifests can be used for manual testing or review

## Configuration

### Image Tags
- Development: `dev-latest` or `dev-[commit-sha]`
- Staging: `staging-latest` or `staging-[commit-sha]`
- Production: `production-latest` or `production-[commit-sha]`

### Resource Configurations

#### Development
```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 256Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi
```

#### Staging
```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 200m
    memory: 256Mi
```

#### Production
```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 1000m
    memory: 1024Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 512Mi
```

## Security Considerations

- All secrets should be managed through AWS Secrets Manager
- Debug mode is disabled in production
- Network policies restrict pod communication
- TLS is enabled for production ingress
- Pods run as non-root users
- Resource limits are enforced
- HPA ensures proper scaling

## Monitoring

- Kubernetes metrics
- Application health checks
- Resource utilization
- Autoscaling behavior
- Deployment status through Argo CD UI

## Contributing
